             * - do something extra before execution (as Polly's CachePolicy does - it checks the cache)
             * - do something extra after execution  (as Polly's CachePolicy does - it stores in the cache a result returned from the execution)
             * - inject something into the execution (as Polly's TimeoutPolicy does - it injects an extra CancellationToken)
             * - delay execution                     (as Simmy's InjectLatencyPolicy does; as Polly's BulkheadEngine does if there is not capacity)
             * - execute it multiple times           (as Polly's RetryPolicy does)
             * - choose not to execute it at all     (as Polly's CircuitBreakerEngine and BulkheadEngine sometimes do)
             *
             * A ProActive policy is not intended to handle exceptions.  For policies handling exceptions, see ReactiveFooPolicy.
